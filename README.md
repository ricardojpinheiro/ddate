# ddate
This is a silly utility which convert dates from Gregorian calendar to the Discordian callendar, which is used by a religious belief called [Discordianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discordianism).

# Requirements
MSX-DOS 2. 80 columns isn't really required, but it's desirable.

# Parameters
- /h or /help - Show this help and exits.
- /v or /version - Show info about version and exits.

# Future
I wanna do some minor changes, like detect how many columns (40 or 80) and changes the output; the use of date format (+%d-%m-%Y, for example); l18n (PT-BR and EN, at least).

# Version notes
Yes, it doesn't have any great features. It's written in Pascal, runs only on MSX-DOS 2, it has some simple (but tricky) functions and I done it in a sleepless Saturday night. 'nuff said.
