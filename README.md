## ddate
This is a silly utility, which convert dates from Gregorian calendar to the Discordian callendar, which is used by a religious belief called [Discordianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discordianism).

Yes, it doesn't have great features. It's written in Pascal, runs only on MSX-DOS 2, it has some simple (but tricky) functions and I done it in a tedious moment. 'nuff said.
